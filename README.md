# ATM

## React useState:

I have used React useState to maintain state of the account total, deposit total, atm Mode, valid transaction status, and input values for deposits.

## UI interface Features:

1. If Deposit or Withdraw is not selected, the Amount Input area will not be available for use.

2. I've set different color for the deposit and withdraw buttons so that they stand out more. Color is an important consideration when designing a UI interface since it can aid in the comprehension of information.

3. The value of the Input field will be set to 0 after the user presses the submit button. This action will give the user a sense of security about the activity they've taken.
